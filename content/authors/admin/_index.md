I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University. I am interested in the historical political economy of development and the interplay between state formation and economic development in the long run. My dissertation studies the conditions under which political regime change can cause state capture and decay. At Princeton, I have taught comparative politics, quantitative methods and R programming. Before coming to Princeton, I got a BA in Political Science from Universidad de San Andres, Argentina, and taught and worked in policy analysis in national and subnational govenment agencies. I also co-authored a general-interest book on political development in Argentina.
