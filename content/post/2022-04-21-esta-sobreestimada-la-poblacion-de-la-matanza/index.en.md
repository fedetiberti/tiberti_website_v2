These are the steps that I took to set up my website using blogdown and the [Hugo Academic (Wochemy)](https://wowchemy.com/) theme. I also did a little ["how to" session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHpkLJieXPE) with some GW political science graduate students where we worked through these steps and got everyone started with a blogdown site. Many of the steps recounted here are based on what I learned from [this super-helpful post](https://alison.rbind.io/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/) by Alison Hill.
